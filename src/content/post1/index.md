Dear friends, family and everyone in between,

I'm finally starting my very own blog. When I was younger I had a blog hosted on blogspot and it always annoyed me that I cannot customize it as much as I want. After learning coding and about static website generaters like GatsbyJS I decided to give this a shot and create a blog without a CMS and instead markdown files. Gatsby is super cool and I am excited to start sharing more content soon.

Now that we are live the challenge will be to actually write :)

This blog will be about:

- Travel (hopefully soon we will be able to travel again as right now the furtherst I've been in a month is to Mercadona, the supermarket 650m away from my house);
- Barcelona (the city I live in at the moment);
- Stefi's shorts (which will be post about stuff that I am thinking about, learning or reflecting on);
- Video (my very own YouTube videos shared here plus other videos I enjoy watching - mainly YouTube videos);
- Recommendations (Books, Podcasts, Movies anything I find usefull and I want to recommend);
- Quotes That Make Me Think;
- Maybe some articles code related.

Hope you will enjoy it!

Cheers :)
