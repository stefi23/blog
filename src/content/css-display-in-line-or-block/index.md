When styling elements on a page it's important to understand what kind of elements these are.
 
## Inline elements 
 
Inline elements are elements that can be put inside block elements without taking a new line. An example of such elements are links &lt;a&gt;that can be inserted for example in titles or paragraphs or &lt;span&gt;.  
 
Another inline element is an image &lt;img&gt;. If you add an image in a paragraph you will see it will be inserted in the text. Itâ€™s important to know that this can be changed. If for example, you want an image to not sit inside the text you could change it's display property to `display: block;`
 
 
- Elements take only that necessary space without occupying a new line 
- They appear next to each other on the same line (e.g. link in a paragraph with a span)
- The height and width of these type of elements cannot be changed
- Examples: p, a, button, input, label, script, iframe, embeded, etc.
 
 
With **inline-block** you can change the width and height. Other than that it behaves just like an inline element.
 
## Block Elements
 
Block-like elements (div, p, h1, etc.) always take a new separate line and stretch out horizontally as far as possible by default.
 
- Elements take the largest possible width, by default.
- Every block element appears on a new line.
- The width and height properties can be used.
- Elements can contain both inline and block elements.
 
 
We also have `display:none` and `visibility:hidden`. The display: none option makes the element disappear without showing the space it took. This is used for example with a sliding navbar to show it on click and then to hide it. On the other hand with visibility: hidden the element is not visible but the space it took cannot be occupied by other elements.
