Living in Barcelona for almost 5 years I have a lot of recommendation of coffee shops, restaurants, place to see, museums and touristic attractions. To make it easier to share this with friends I have decided to create a <a  class="articleLink" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1_AbMYdBiQDeHYSW9ipuHl0lMhoClA0F0&usp=sharing">Google Map</a> that can be added as a layer on ones Google Maps.

The places I've added have a small note of why I put them on the lists and some tips and tricks. For example if I share a museum, you might find the info of how to get free tickets to this it.

I recommend checking before going to a place to make sure it's still open. Unfortunately due to the pandemic some places had closed. I'm constantly updating it.

Feel free to share this map with friends and if there is a place you think should be on the map let me know I would like to go check it out. You can reach me via Twitter or Instagram. Thank you!

Enjoy!
