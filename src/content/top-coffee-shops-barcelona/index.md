As someone who loves specialty coffee and has been living in Barcelona for the past 5 years, I want to share with you my favorite roastery coffee spots and as well as why I recommend them.

Let’s get into it.

## 1. Little Fern

Little Fern is a coffee shop and brunch place located in Poblenou, also known as 22@ Barcelona Innovation District.

Pre-pandemic I used to get my coffee here daily. As an expat I had a hard time integrating in Spain and the work culture and thankfully I had this lovely place to go for a little chat. Nick and the rest of the staff are wonderful people who'll make you smile even on a rainy day. If you go when they open there you might catch them dancing while preping the space. A the entrance you will a board a new motivational/fun message to kickstart your day.

Foodwise the place has become plant based and they have a variaty of delicous dishes. The Rey Reay Buger with a crispy fried vegan buttermilk oyster mushrooms and mustard sauce being my personal favorite.

During weekends the place is a bit more crowded as a lot of people stop by before heading down to the beach.

</p>

A cute small little coffee shop to be found in Eixample where you will be greated with a warm "Ciao Bella", as the owner is a really friendly Italian guy. Even if you go for the first time the place you will feel like local. The staff here takes the time to chat with you asks you about your day.

Besides great coffee here you can also find delicious cakes, and breakfast food. Their avocado toast is one of my favourites.

## 3. Hidden Coffee

</p>

As the title tells this coffee shop is more "hidden" as it is not in a central area or more popular neighberhood. Although they've now opened up two other spots, one in El Born and the other one in Poble Nou, I wanna talk to you about the one located in Les Corts.

In my personal top the coffee here ranks no.1 and the fact that they also offer a glass of water with coffee is a nice addition.

The place is quite small with a few tables outside. I like getting coffee here as it is less loud, less crowded and a good 20 min walk from my home. In case it's full there is a small park closebye. On the weekends a lot of bikers come to grab a cup as they are heading out of back to town.

They have a big variety of sweets but not as much breakfast food as the rest of places mentioned.

## 4. Manso's Cafe

<p style=" padding-top:0" >

</p>

Manso Cafe is a coffee place I don't go to as often too but highly recommend it. It's located in Sant Antoni, a really cool neigbourhood with a lot of restaurants, pedestrian areas and more coffee shops.

Besides great coffee here you will find delicious Swedish pastry, their cinnamon roll is just amazing homemade cake and a great variety of breakfast food.

## 5. El Café De La Central

<p style=" padding-top:0" >

</p>

El Café De La Central can be found on the first floor of the La Central library. The coffee is the same as in the Satans coffee shops as it has the same owner and is less popular as not many people know of it's existance. Once you enter you have to go upstairs and there is a quite indoor terrace. Whenever I go I see people here studying, reading or just having a chat. They don't have wifi and not many food options at the moment. If you wanna to escape from the city while still being in the center this could be the place.

The coffee is a bit pricy 2.5 euro for a cafe con leche (coffee with milk).

Tip: The Bar Central Raval from the library in Raval is bigger has a nice terrace and food options.
