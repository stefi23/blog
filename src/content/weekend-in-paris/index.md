At the beginning of December 2019, I went to Paris to give a talk and decided to stay for a couple of days and explore. Besides the obvious which is eating croissants, bread with butter and jam and eclairs here's what I did:
<br />

<b>

1. Visit the Sacré-Cœur Basilica and its Dom
2. Admire Van Gogh's paitings at the Musée d’Orsay
3. Stroll around Jardin du Luxembourg
4. Read in Tuileries Gardens
5. See the Eiffel Tower up close

Bonus: See Napoleon III Apartments at the Louvre Museum

## 1. Visit the Sacré-Cœur Basilica

My hotel was located in the charming Montmartre neighborhood which made it clear that I would first go to the Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Be aware that the Basilica is on top of a hill. It is open every day from 6.30 am to 10.30 pm and the entrance is free. Once here you have the option to go all the 300 steps up to the Dome for a stunning view. The Dom though is only open between 10.30 am to 7.00 pm and has an admission fee. My favorite time to go enjoy this view is around sunset.

## 2. Admire Van Gogh's paitings at the Musée d’Orsay

Next on my list was the Musée d’Orsay, to see the world's largest impressionist collection and admire the building. When you enter you might notice an unusual inside and the reason for this is because this building used to be the former Gare d’Orsay, a railway station and hotel. While here make sure you don't miss rooms 71 and 72 on level 2 where most of Van Gogh's paintings including Starry Night Over the Rhone are to be found and level 5 where the most famous works are located. From the 5th floor through a large glass clock you can get a different view of Paris.

The museum is open: 9.30 am – 6pm Tues-Sun (9.45pm on Thursdays) and closed on Mondays. The last ticket is sold 1 hour before closing. Admission is 16€ and I recommend <a href='www.musee-orsay.fr/en/visit/admission/ticket-purchase.html' target="_blank" class="articleLink"> buying tickets online</a> in advance.

## 3. Read in Jardin du Luxembourg

This park is the best place to relax and enjoy a bit of fresh air. Try to spot the Medici Fountain, some statues, and afterward grab a chair in front of the fountain where you will spot children sailing their tiny boats.

## 4. Stroll around Tuileries Gardens

Another beautiful place to read is the Tuileries Gardens. For me sitting next to this round fountain on a sunny day, listening to the sound of water, while reading is the recipe for happiness.

## 5. See the Eiffel Tower up close

Everyone who knows about Paris knows about the Eiffel Tower. It's a key landmark of France's capital city and one that has stood up to quite a lot during its lifetime. It was built for the Exposition Universelle of 1889 by Gustave Eiffel, which marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution to demonstrate France's industrial power. The construction took around 2 years and is one of the most visited landmarks. 20 years later it was supposed to be destroyed but was saved thanks to science, and was the place from which the very first radio contact in Morse code between the Eiffel Tower and the Pantheon, four kilometers away took place. If you're curious I leave you with a short video giving you more details on this site.

If you want to go up make sure you <a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en" target="_blank" class="articleLink">reserve in advance</a>.

Opening times: Spring holidays timetable: opening from 9am to 11.45pm from April 16 to May 1st included. From May 2 to 7, opening from 9.30am (instead of 9) to 11.45pm.

## Bonus: See Napoleon III Apartments at the Louvre Museum

The Louvre Museum is huge and hard to see in one day. I'd personally recommend seeing the Mona Lisa painting, to cross that off the list, go to the Egyptian collection and the Napoleon III Apartments

The museum is open daily from 9am to 6pm except for Tuesdays. Last entry 1 hour before closure. Tickets purchased online are 17 € vs 15 € purchased at the museum. I always recommend online especially if you are there for only a weekend with a limited time.
