Brittany, French Bretagne is a region in the northwest corner of France, a region where you can walk through fortified and medival towns, visit castles and eat lot of butter, crepes and other yummi things.

Doing a road trip in this region doesn't involve a lot of driving. The distances between towns are mostly under 1 hour and even though we went in August finding parking was not very stresful and it didn't feel crowded.

**About the trip:**

- **Duration:** 7 days
- **Dates visited:** 15 Aug - 21 Aug
- **Recommended accommodation close to Mont Saint Michel:**  
  <a href='https://www.booking.com/hotel/fr/auberge-de-la-baie.en-gb.html' target="_blank" class="articleLink">Auberge de la Baie</a> - a small hotel that is a 45 min walk away from Mont Saint Michel. The walk is really beautiful as you are in the middle of a field while facing the town and walking towards it. You'll probably encounter a lot of sheeps on this fields.

**General tips for road tripping in Brittany, France:**

- Reserve a table in advance. If you don't have a reservation try to go before they start serving lunch/dinner.
- Be patient service can be slow or go to a place where they serve crepes and galettes as they get cooked way faster.
- Breakfast: 7:30 - 9AM | Lunch: 12:30–2PM | Dinner: 7:30–9PM. Coming from Spain it was a bit challenging to adapt to the eating times in France especially in the small towns where these are kinda strict.
- Be prepared to speak some French not everyone speaks English.
- Be aware that on the highways you might not find rest stops or gas station. Distance are short though. Plan accordingly.
- Google Maps timetable are not always accurate. If traveling in August it might be that a shop, restaurant or gas station is closed as people are on vacation.
- When putting gas and paying by card you might at first get 120-150 euros blocked on your account and immediatly after returned based on how much you've actually spent on gas.
- Most towns have free parking options. Although these are mostly full on arrival if you are patient someone might just finished visiting and might leave. Some small towns have limited time free parking and the parking is mostly free on weekends and holidays.
- Difficult and expensive to park inside the cities preferably book hotels a bit outside that offer free parking.
- In Nantes you can park at a P&R (park and ride) spot and for the ticket you can get for free to and back from the city for up to 5 people.

## France, Brittany itinerary and map

Even though this is a 7 days itinerary if time is limited some of the spots/cities can be skipped. Where I would definitely want to go is: Dinan, Mont Saint Michel (even though this is technically in the Normandy region), Josseline, Quimper, Saint-Malo or Concarneau and Huelgoat if you are a nature lover and up for a short hike. One place we didn't make it even though we had it planned is Carnac, a town best known for the Carnac stones, thousands of prehistoric standing stones spread across three alignments.

## Day 1 - Nantes

Our trip starts in Nantes where we flew to from Barcelona. An alternative could be flying to Rennes and starting there. At the airport we've rented a car and we're ready to go.

**What to do in Nantes:**

- Walk through the **Botanical Garden (Jardin des Plantes)**. You might spot some of <a href="instagram.com/jean_jullien" class="articleLink" target="_blank">Jean Jullien's</a> characters around.
- Go see the **Machines de L'ile** where you can see some giant mechanical animals that have move in an impresive way. While here you can can also ride the **Grand Elephant**. Keep in mind that these are 2 seperate tickets. The Elephant goes on it's walk outside and you can see it for free. If you though want to one or both of these tours make sure you <a href="https://reservation.lesmachines-nantes.fr/content?lang=en" target="_blank" class="articleLink">book online in advance.</a>
- Walk on the walls and inside the **Château des ducs de Bretagne** for free.

**Recommendations:**

- Small cozy vegetarian restaurant: **Oh K-fée d'Mj**. Order some of the syrop water it's so good!
- **Artichoke Gallery Cafe:** speciality coffee (a bit pricy ~ 4 euros) and brunch served too, book in advance otherwise you won't be able to eat there.

All these spots can be found on the road trip map.

## Day 2 - Josseline, Vannes, Auray

Getting from Nantes to Josseline took us around 1:45 - 2:00h and was one of the longest ridde during the whole trip.

**What to do in Josseline:**

- Walk around the streets and to the main square
- visit **Chateau de Josselin** - around 10 euros for the gardens and one floor.
- Get lunch.

After visiting Josseline and having lunch at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wXzd2ERHt1QxNUdL9" target="_blank" class="articleLink">Le Bistrot</a>in their main plaza where luckily they had 2 vegatarian dishes (Took 1 hour to get the food.) we got into the car and drove to Vannes.

Parking in Vannes felt a bit more complicated. While arriving to town we already saw a sign showing that the 2 out of the 3 main paid parkings where complete. Although this is the message you see, luckily you can still enter the parking and find a spot as people are leaving and I guess the sign doesn't get updated in real time. For about 2-3h we paid around 7 euros.

**What to do in Vannes:**

- Vannes Ramparts - walls
- Jardin des Remparts - Gardens
- Les Vieux Lavoirs - Laundry thing
- Place Henri IV
- Porte Saint-Vincent
- Port de Vannes and Houses
- Bakery to buy Gallete Bretagne

- Vannes, bigger city, hard to find free parking, most paid parkings full (but wait as someone always leaves)
- Port in Vannes and Houses

From Vannes we drove to Auray and checked in to a hotel just a bit outside of the city.

## Day 3 - Auray, Pont Aven, Concarneau, Quimper

- Auray really nice small port, felt like I was in a Popey movie
- Pont Avent super small
- Concarneau small town inside a fortress
- Quimper:
  - Lots of places to eat crepe, a square full of restaurants
  - Breakfast
  - Dinner (vegetarian friendly)

## Day 4 - Quimper, Huelgoat, Morlaix, Saint-Brieuc

- Huelgoat intresting hike among huge stones
- Morlaix walk in the middle viaduct
- Saint-Brieuc not much, nice to go to the coast

## Day 5 - Dinan, Saint-Malo, Mont Saint-Michel

- Dinnan personal favorite
- Long cobblestone street all the way down to the port
- Hike back up from the port on a different less steep road
- Saint-Malo fortress town where you can walk on the walls
- Arrive at the hotel close to Mont Saint-Michel and went for a walk to Mont Saint-Michel.

**Tips to visit Mont Saint-Michel**

- book in advance
- go early or late
- shuttle bus available but can have a longer waiting time
- Night visit during summer

## Day 6 - Mont Saint-Michel, Fougères, Rennes

- Impressive: Mont Saint-Michel
- Book in advances (night tour summer)
- Best time either morning around 10am or in the evening (closes at 7pm outside of summer)
- Low tide in summer, can walk around the mount
- Hotels inside expensive but might be worth the experience - our hotel 30-45min walk through the filed
- Fougères super small town, castle (didn't visit)
- Rennes, captila of Bretagne colorful, speciality coffee and crepes

## Day 7 - Nantes

- Fly back home, get your last crepe and some bretagne cookies

End of trip :)

- Notes:

Before you go to Northern Greece
Here are a couple of facts to get you started planning your trip, such as exactly which dates I traveled (so you get an understanding of the weather), how long I was there, which guidebook I used and where exactly I stayed. Later in the guide you’ll also see a map of all locations and tips for each spot. Enjoy!

## Bonus: Make sure you eat some of these:

- creps
- galets bretagne
- mussels

**Crepe or galette? What is the difference?**
Creps are usually sweet filled with butter, caramel, jam etc. while galettes are typically savoury served with cheese, eggs, etc.

Before we get into it I want to share some recommendation that might help make your trip a bit better. Given the high number of tourism they receive it can be that the service is not the best and that you might have to wait even over 1 hour for your food to be served. My advice would be if possible to go early to a restaurant you plan to eat or even better if possible to reserve in advance. While in the trip it happened multiple times that even though it looked like there were tables when asked for a spot I've heared multiple times: "Sorry, no reservation, no table. We are full." It happens especially 45-60min before closing time.

To add to this even in the most touristic places the majority of people didn't speak or understand English.
