Looking back it's funny how I used to look at CSS art on codepen and think that I would never be able to do something similar. Around this time codepen sents a newsletter including a <a style="color: #942874; text-decoration:underline" target="blank" href="https://codepen.io/collection/AeovRz ">holdiday #CodePenChallenge</a>. Those were impressive but not something I would touch until now.

After going through some CSS basics tutorials I wanted to better understand how `position: absolute` and `position: relative` work. What better way to do this than by making a project ðŸ˜Š

Digging a bit deeper I realized that by getting a better understanding of CSS I might be able to build a CSS pure image myself. I've seen <a style="color: #942874; text-decoration:underline" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ania_kubow">Ania KubÃ³w </a> robot in one of her <a style="color: #942874; text-decoration:underline" target="blank" href="https://scrimba.com/playlist/pVLpVsk">Scrimba</a> courses and after checking the code I slowly made sense of it. The next step was to do a little tutorial on Pure CSS Images and I found great one <a style="color: #942874; text-decoration:underline" target="blank" href="https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2">here</a>. Michael Mangialardi explains things very well and made this less intimidating. I have to add that I used Photoshop a bit in the past and have some understanding of layers work.This probably helped.

I won't consider my simple Christmas Robot art but I am pretty proud to have done it.

The design was inspired by the <a style="color: #942874; text-decoration:underline" target="blank" href="http://robothousebcn.com/">Robot House</a> coffeeshop in Barcelona. This was my coffee go-to place in November. Here I found a wonderful woman at the counter, probably the owner, who was always available for a bit of conversation and who helped me get through the day. I'm not sure if she needed me as a client or if I needed here more to get away from my home desk and "challenging" job.

If curious you can find the code on <a style="color: #942874; text-decoration:underline" target="blank" href="https://codepen.io/stefi23/pen/YzGZEYg">CodePen</a> as well as on my <a style="color: #942874; text-decoration:underline" target="blank" href="https://github.com/stefi23/christmas-robot">GitHub</a>.

Hope this will be the beginning of more such projects.

For those who are looking at images created with CSS like I used to I say that it might look hard and intimidating but if you start small you can draw some nice things too.

ðŸ¤¶ðŸ¤– Feliz Navidad!
