I made many of my friends watch this video and watched it myself a million times. It’s not only about Banff but his touch of the story got me interested in this place.</p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 \">\n  <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r25IWquxe9s\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<p>Later on Peter published another video called “The Mountains Won’t Remember Me” which shows the same region.</p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 \">\n  <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Z0lv6qlj0Q\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<p>At this point I started thinking about planning a trip and seeing this place myself.\nDays went by and as Youtube magically remembered that I’m into Banff content it recommended <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/johnnyharris\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"articleLink\">Johnny Harris</a> video called “Why Canada's Mountains Feel Like Switzerland | Banff, Lake Louise, and Sunshine Village”.</p>\n<p>You don’t know this but 3 years ago I did an exercise called: “Your Ten-Year Plan for a Remarkable Life”. Long story short, in 10 years from now I dream about living in Switzerland. Although NYC is my favorite place, Switzerland feels like the ideal plan to live with my future kids and partner.\n<br></p>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 \">\n  <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eOa1zbBureI\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<p>Canada was somehow this place far away about which I didn’t know that much. Now somehow the dots are being connected and it’s time to go.\nReceiving this book as a gift today found me crying of joy. The book is filled with plenty of information on planning a trip there. In the next few weeks I want to start building that plan. I never really properly planed a trip but given the fact that I’m unsure when this could happen I got plenty of time to do it differently and see how it goes.</p>\n<p>You might think I’m crazy for planning something during these uncertain times. Dreaming about the future and allowing myself to believe this could happen brings me a lot of joy. At the end if I won’t make it at least I will know so much more about this magic place called Banff.</p>\n<p><em>“Thinking about tomorrow brings it closer and makes it real.
