Around this time codepen sents a newsletter including a <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://codepen.io/collection/AeovRz \">holdiday #CodePenChallenge</a>. Those were impressive but not something I would touch until now.</p>\n<p>After going through some CSS basics tutorials I wanted to better understand how <code>position: absolute</code> and <code>position: relative</code> work. What better way to do this than by making a project ðŸ˜Š</p>\n<p>Digging a bit deeper I realized that by getting a better understanding of CSS I might be able to build a CSS pure image myself. I've seen <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ania_kubow\">Ania KubÃ³w </a> robot in one of her <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://scrimba.com/playlist/pVLpVsk\">Scrimba</a> courses and after checking the code I slowly made sense of it. The next step was to do a little tutorial on Pure CSS Images and I found great one <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2\">here</a>. Michael Mangialardi explains things very well and made this less intimidating. I have to add that I used Photoshop a bit in the past and have some understanding of layers work.This probably helped.</p>\n<p>I won't consider my simple Christmas Robot art but I am pretty proud to have done it.</p>\n<h2>Christmas Robot created with Pure CSS</h2>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 405px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/blog/static/bb7e57907398648d3a6431b4a59d58c2/1d180/christmas-robot.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 95.27027027027027%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Christmas Robot\"\n        title=\"Christmas Robot\"\n        src=\"/blog/static/bb7e57907398648d3a6431b4a59d58c2/1d180/christmas-robot.png\"\n        srcset=\"/blog/static/bb7e57907398648d3a6431b4a59d58c2/12f09/christmas-robot.png 148w,\n/blog/static/bb7e57907398648d3a6431b4a59d58c2/e4a3f/christmas-robot.png 295w,\n/blog/static/bb7e57907398648d3a6431b4a59d58c2/1d180/christmas-robot.png 405w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The design was inspired by the <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"http://robothousebcn.com/\">Robot House</a> coffeeshop in Barcelona.

Here I found a wonderful woman at the counter, probably the owner, who was always available for a bit of conversation and who helped me get through the day.
