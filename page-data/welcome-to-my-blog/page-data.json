When I was younger I had a blog hosted on Blogspot and it always annoyed me that I cannot customize it as much as I wanted. After learning to code and about static website generators like Gatsby I decided to give this a shot and create my blog without a CMS and instead use markdown files. Gatsby is super cool and I am excited to start sharing more content soon.</p>\n<p>Now that we are live the challenge will be to actually write :)</p>\n<p>This blog will be about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel (hopefully soon we will be able to travel again as right now the furthest I've been in a month is to Mercadona, the supermarket 650m away from my house);</li>\n<li>Barcelona (the city I live in at the moment);</li>\n<li>Stefi's shorts (which will be post about stuff that I am thinking about, learning or reflecting on);</li>\n<li>Video (my very own YouTube videos shared here plus other videos I enjoy watching - mainly YouTube videos);</li>\n<li>Recommendations (Books, Podcasts, Movies anything I find useful and I want to recommend);</li>\n<li>Quotes That Make Me Think;</li>\n<li>Maybe some articles code related. -> update: I've created a separate blog for this</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you will enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Cheers :)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PS.
