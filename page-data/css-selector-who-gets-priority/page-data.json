I knew it was classes above element selectors but was never very sure about the rest until recently when I did a <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://scrimba.com/playlist/pVLpVsk\">CSS Fundamentals</a> course by <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://youtube.com/kevinpowell\">Kevin Powell</a> on <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://scrimba.com/\">Scrimba</a>.</p>\n<p>It might sound strange but I was not aware of the term <b>specificity</b> until this moment. A term I'm not sure I can pronounce.</p>\n<p>Specificity bascically is the answer to my CSS selectors prioritisation question. Before we get into that here is a more official definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Specificity</b> is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity\">*source</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order words specificity is the way CSS styling will be prioritized based on the CSS selectors defined.</p>\n<p>So how does CSS priority or otherwise said CSS specificity work? Here you can see the CSS selectors from lowest priority to the highest priority (specificity):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>tag selectors</b> like for example an h1 or p tag are worth 1</li>\n<li><b>.class selectors</b> are worth 10</li>\n<li><b>#id selectors</b> are worth 100</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To better illustrate this let’s look at the following example.</p>\n<!-- <pre class=\"line-numbers\" style=\"max-width=300px; background: #352d39; color:#e3f4f5; font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif\">\n<code class=\"language-markup\">\n  <h1 class=\"title\" id=\"title\">Hello world!</h1>\n  </code>\n</pre> -->\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\" style=\"max-width=300px; background: #352d39; color:#e3f4f5; font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif\">\n<code>\n &lt;h1 class=\"title\" id=\"title\"&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;\n \n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\" style=\"max-width=300px; background: #352d39; color:#e3f4f5; font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif\">\n <code class=\"language-html\">\n  h1 {\n      color: red;\n  }\n\n  .title {\n      color: green;\n  }\n\n  #title {\n      color: pink;\n  }\n </code>\n</pre>\n<p>This will output a pink title as its id selector has the highest priority.</p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\" style=\"max-width=300px; background: #352d39; color:#e3f4f5; font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif\">\n <code class=\"language-markup\">\n <h1 class=\"title\" id=\"title\"> Hello, world!</h1>\n <style>\n  h1{\n      color:red;\n  }\n  .title{\n      color:green;\n  }\n  #title{\n      color:pink!important;\n  }\n  </style>\n </code>\n</pre>\n<p>It's important to note that the selector with the highest priority will prevail. The order in which the CSS rules appear won't matter. I want to also add that I would never name a <code>class</code> the same way as an <code>id</code>. This specific case where I used <code>class=\"title\" id=\"title\"</code> is only intended to highlight the specificity better.</p>\n<p>To add to this, if you would have repeaded something in your stylesheet like for example:</p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers\" style=\"max-width=300px; background: #352d39; color:#e3f4f5; font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif\">\n <code class=\"language-html\">\n  h1 {\n      color: red;\n  }\n  h1 {\n      color: green;\n  }\n  h1 {\n      color: pink;\n  }\n </code>\n</pre>\n<p>Know that the last one defined will be the lucky winner in case they are all having the same priority(specificity).</p>\n<p><u>Summary:</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>#title{ color: pink;}</code> is the most specific one as ids must be unique throughout a webpage, and should only target one element.</li>\n<li><code>.title{ color: green;}</code> one the other hand can target any HTML element with a <code>class=\"title\"</code> attribute, and is, therefore, less specific that and id selector.</li>\n<li>Consequentaly <code>h1 {color: red;}</code> is the least specific as it can target any HTML header 1 tag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To end I will add that the inline style has a higher priority than the style defined in the internal or external style sheet and by using !important you can override other selectors but <a style=\"color: #942874; text-decoration:underline\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3706819/what-are-the-implications-of-using-important-in-css\">I've read that it's not a good practice</a>. I will let you dig more into that on your own as I will myself.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CSS selectors - Who gets priority?","date":"December 24, 2020","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/blog/static/bc23ca6ce64945fca1b3fde106d6b619/2a4de/css-specificity.png"}}}},"excerpt":"I always wondered how CSS selectors get priority.
