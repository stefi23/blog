I read on a blog that it's a really good brunch place. Happily, it was full so I went across the street to this nice and cozy place called Cafe B√∫ho. I got a coffee, did some reading and writing. It was perfect. When I got up and said I'd like to pay I've got this reply: \"That's good!\" Or something like that. For a moment I felt offended. It sounded as if the waiter was saying: \"Oh, finally you're leaving!\" So I asked: \"Why?\" He smiled: \"It's great when people pay before they leave.\"</p>\n<p>Today I had brunch there again and did my usual reading and writing. When I wanted to pay though, surprise! I had forgotten my wallet. I checked all pockets but had less than 10 euros. I went up to him and told him that I cannot pay and that I'll have to go get my wallet. I also added that I was really sorry. As if nothing happened he told me not to worry. It's all fine. Minutes after I reached home it started pouring. So now I had to wait until the rain would stop. When I got back the waiter said: \"when it started to rain so badly I thought that you won't make it anymore and you will come back tomorrow.\" He was so relaxed about it. I apologized again and told him I wouldn't have waited a day. With his eyes twinkled he said: \"Don't worry about it.\" üòä</p>\n<p>If you are in Barcelona and want to have coffee go to a place where people trust you.\nSuch a place could be Cafe B√∫ho.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Cafe Buho has closed in the meantime.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On Trust","tags":["coffee","Barcelona","trust","fun"],"categories":"Barcelona","date":"September 09, 2017","description":null,"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/static/3152ce1b27fbc7c8d475bcc58414a27c/4fe8c/on-trust.jpg"}}}},"excerpt":"Saturday coffee at Cafe Buho One Saturday I was trying to get a coffee at Granja Petitbo in Barcelona.
