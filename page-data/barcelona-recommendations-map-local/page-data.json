To make it easier to share this with friends I have decided to create a Google Map that can be added as a layer on ones Google Maps.</p>\n<p>The places I've added have a small note of why I put them on the lists and some tips and tricks. For example if I share a museum, you might find the info of how to get free tickets to this it.</p>\n<p>I recommend checking before going to a place to make sure it's still open. Unfortunately due to the pandemic some places had closed. I'm constantly updating it.</p>\n<p>Feel free to share this map with friends and if there is a place you think should be on the map let me know I would like to go check it out. You can reach me via Twitter or Instagram.
