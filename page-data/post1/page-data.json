When I was younger I had a blog hosted on blogspot and it always annoyed me that I cannot customize it as much as I want. After learning coding and about static website generaters like GatsbyJS I decided to give this a shot and create a blog without a CMS and instead markdown files. Gatsby is super cool and I am excited to start sharing more content soon.</p>\n<p>Now that we are live the challenge will be to actually write :)</p>\n<p>This blog will be about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel (hopefully soon we will be able to travel again as right now the furtherst I've been in a month is to Mercadona, the supermarket 650m away from my house);</li>\n<li>Barcelona (the city I live in at the moment);</li>\n<li>Stefi's shorts (which will be post about stuff that I am thinking about, learning or reflecting on);</li>\n<li>Video (my very own YouTube videos shared here plus other videos I enjoy watching - mainly YouTube videos);</li>\n<li>Recommendations (Books, Podcasts, Movies anything I find usefull and I want to recommend);</li>\n<li>Quotes That Make Me Think;</li>\n<li>Maybe some articles code related.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you will enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Cheers :)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PS.
